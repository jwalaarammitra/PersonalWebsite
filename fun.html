<h3>Meet my dance team, Boiler Bhangra.</h3>

<center><img src="bb.jpg" alt="boiler bhangra" style="width:75%"></center>

<p>I have been dancer on Boiler Bhangra, a nationally competitive team at Purdue 
  University since 2019. My current board position in Treasurer. From handling my
  team's financial activities, I have learned budgeting and resourcefulness. 
  As a dancer and performer, I have practiced commitment. Apart from the skills I 
  have gained on this team, I have made strong friendships and understood the 
  importance of syngery. I absolutely love performing for competitions! This past year, 
  we were fortunate enough to compete virtually dispite not being able to travel due to 
  COVID-19. Below is our performance at Buckeye Mela 2021 hosted by Ohio State University 
  in which we placed third. Our performance begins at 1:08:22 and I am in the yellow vardi.</p>
